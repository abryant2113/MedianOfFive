# MedianOfFive
This .java file contains an algorithm created by H.B. Demuth, which computes the median of a set of any five arbitrary values
in at most seven comparisons. There are numerous uses for this algorithm, such as determining an optimal pivot point for a 
QuickSort algorithm--pick five random values from your list, determine the median, then use that as your pivot point.
